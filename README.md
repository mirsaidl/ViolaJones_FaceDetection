# Viola-Jones Face Detection

Welcome to our project on face detection using the **Viola-Jones algorithm**, part of our Digital Image Processing course. This repository is maintained by ***Team #5***, working collaboratively to implement and demonstrate face detection techniques using this well-known algorithm. 

## Dataset

You can download the dataset from dataset.zip
```
git clone https://github.com/mirsaidl/ViolaJones_FaceDetection.git
unzip dataset.zip
```

## About the Project

The **Viola-Jones face detection algorithm** is one of the most successful object detection methods, renowned for its real-time performance and accuracy in detecting human faces. This project is dedicated to understanding, implementing, and showcasing the effectiveness of the algorithm in various scenarios.

Our project demonstrates:
- **Face detection**: Using Haar-like features to identify faces in images.
- **Bounding box classification**: Identifying and bounding faces within different environments and backgrounds.

## Features

- **Accurate Face Detection**: Efficiently locates faces across diverse image sets.
- **Bounding Box Classification**: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces with high precision.
- **Demo Video**:
